<strong>Apple packet price planner</strong>
_____________________________________________________________________________

A friend of yours has a side hustle buying boxes of apples at the local fruit market and then making that up in packets to sell. She needs a widget that can help her to plan how many packets she can create from a box she bought from the market - the number of apples in these boxes varies.

<strong>Requirements</strong>
<strong>Create a widget that allows her to enter:</strong>

How much she paid for a box of apples at the market,
the number of apples in the box that she bought,
How many apples she would like to sell in a packet,
and the percentage of profit she would like to make per packet.

<strong>The widget should then calculate four things for her:</strong>

The cost price per apple (how much 1 apple costs to buy),
The cost price per packet (how much all the apples in a packet would cost to buy),
The number of packets that can be made from the number of apples in the box
The price for which a packet of apples should be sold to make the required profit percentage.  


<strong>You should : </strong>
create the HTML & CSS for this widget
Create a Function / Factory function for the application logic and test it using Mocha JS
Link the application logic to the input fields & buttons using the DOM with JavaScript

Make sure you have some functionality working end to end. Do this incrementally getting each calculation done 1 by 1 and then deploy. Then start the next one. Even if you do the Factory Function later. Just get some functionality working on the screen.

You may explore beyond the basics in this exercise, if you have time remaining.
